# Servers
Small python project focused on OOP

Description:

Few holesalers created universal system for handling catalogs of their products. System is focused on clients who want to check products price in 
chosen holesaler.
Every holesaler has it's own server with catalog containing their products. Storage informations method is different between servers.
System goal is not to connect all servers in one network. The goal is to allow effective implementation in every single holesaler (separately).
